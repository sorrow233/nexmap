# FUTURE_ALPHA: Visionary Features & Evolution

> This document details extreme, forward-looking features that push the boundaries of what MixBoard Canvas can do, assuming technical resources are available.

## 1. Autonomous AI Agents (The "Living" Board)

### 1.1 Agent Nodes
Instead of passive "Chat Cards", introduce "Agent Cards" that run in the background.
- **Behavior**: They can read other cards, traverse connections, and autonomously generate new insights or reorganize the board.
- **Example**: A "Research Agent" that monitors a "Topic Zone", auto-searches the web for updates every hour, and spawns new "News Cards" connected to the topic.

### 1.2 Collaborative Agents
Two AI agents (e.g., "Skeptic" and "Optimist") can debate a topic on the board without user intervention, generating a tree of arguments for the user to review.

## 2. Spatial Reality & 3D Interface

### 2.1 Infinite Z-Axis
Expand the 2D canvas to 3D.
- **Stacking**: Stack cards deeply to represent history or versions.
- **VR/AR Integration**: Use Apple Vision Pro or Quest to walk through the mindmap. "Sprouting" becomes literally pulling ideas out of cards in 3D space.

## 3. Multimodal Real-Time Interaction

### 3.1 Voice Command & Conversational Canvas
- **"Hey Board, organize this mess"**: Voice commands that trigger complex actions (auto-layout, grouping).
- **Voice-to-Card**: Dictate thoughts that instantly appear as cards, with AI auto-summarizing and tagging them.

### 3.2 Live Video Analysis
- Drag a live camera feed onto the canvas. AI analyzes the video stream in real-time and spawns cards based on visual events (e.g., "Motion detected", "Text recognized on whiteboard").

## 4. Universal Knowledge Graph

### 4.1 Cross-Board Linking
Allow connections between cards on *different* boards (Wormholes).
- Creating a "Personal Knowledge Graph" that spans all user projects.

### 4.2 Semantic Neural Search
- Search not just by keywords, but by meaning. "Show me everything related to 'Startup Growth'" retrieves cards from 10 different boards, even if they don't contain those exact words, using vector embeddings.

## 5. Plugin Ecosystem

### 5.1 "Skill" Cards
Allow developers to write "Skill Cards" (mini-apps) that run on the board.
- **Examples**: A "Spotify Card" that controls music, a "Jira Card" that syncs tickets, a "Python Card" that executes code in the browser (Pyodide).
