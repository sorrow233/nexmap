# FUTURE_ALPHA: The Visionary Horizon

This document outlines extreme, cutting-edge features that push the boundaries of what a "Mind Map" can be, leveraging advanced AI and theoretical web capabilities.

## 1. Generative UI ("The Shapeshifter")
**Concept**: The card is not just text; it adapts its interface to the content.
- **Dynamic Interfaces**: If you talk about "Music", the card creates a playable synthesizer UI. If you talk about "Stocks", it spawns a live chart.
- **Implementation**: AI generates React components on the fly (sandboxed) based on context, compiling and rendering them into the card instantly.

## 2. The "Mind Mirror" (Contextual Omni-Presence)
**Concept**: The AI doesn't just read the board; it reads your environment.
- **Screen Awareness**: (Desktop App) The AI watches your active window (e.g., you are reading a PDF). It proactively "sprouts" relevant notes on your second monitor's mind map without you typing.
- **Voice Thinking**: A toggle-able "Listener" mode where you verbally ramble, and the AI structures your speech into a coherent mind map in real-time.

## 3. Recursive fractal Boards
**Concept**: Infinite nesting with context preservation.
- **World-in-a-Grain**: Zooming into a card reveals an entirely new infinite canvas.
- **Continuity**: The "Parent" board summary passes down as system instructions to the "Child" board, giving the child context. Conversely, the child board aggregates to a live summary on the parent card.

## 4. 4D Time-Travel Maps
**Concept**: Version control as a spatial dimension.
- **Evolution Playback**: A scrubber slider to watch your thought process evolve (video-like).
- **Branching History**: Create a "fork" of your board state at 2:00 PM to try a different brainstorming direction, visualizing the timeline divergence as a literal 3D z-axis stack of boards.

## 5. Neural-Symbolic Reasoning Engine
**Concept**: Moving beyond LLM text prediction to logic verification.
- **Truth Checking**: If you map out a logical argument or a coding architecture, a symbolic engine verifies for fallacies, circular dependencies, or impossible states, highlighting them in red (like a spellchecker for logic).
